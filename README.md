This repository contains three sets of files in .zip folders  

1. eFish_V1.0.zip

Contains:

1.1. eFish_V1.0_PCB_Picture.PNG 
(illustration of PCB - created in Eagle)

1.2. eFish_V1.0_Schematic_Picture.PNG
(illustration of circuit schematic - created in Eagle)

1.3. eFish_Finder_V1.0_Eagle_files.zip

(contains two files that can be opened and Edited in Eagle: eFish_Finder_V1.0.brd, eFish_Finder_V1.0.brd)

1.4. eFish_Finder_V1.0_Gerber_files.zip

(.zip compressed folder containing 8 files. This zip folder and its contents is required by PCB manufacturing companies)

We recommend pcbway.com (https://www.pcbway.com/)

2. eFish_V1.0_B.zip

Contains the same set of files as in eFish_V1.0.zip for an alternative version of the circuit board in which resistor R1 is replaced with a jumper (J1) for resistor insertion. 
This alternative design permits the user to remove and add resistors to vary the gain of the bio-amplifier. This may be helpful in special circumsances: e.g. use in water with very high conductivity.

3. eFishV_1.0_Resources.zip

Contains: 
3.1. Component list for PCB assembly, including bio-amplifier chassis and probe assembly
3.2. Design and construction notes
3.3. Operation manual
3.4. Publications describing earlier versions
