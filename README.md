1.4. eFish_Finder_V1.0A_Gerber_20190920.zip

(.zip compressed folder containing 8 files)
	
This zip folder and its contents is required by PCB manufacturing companies)

1.5. README_eFish_Finder_V1.0A_20190920.txt

Key to the PCB schematic and circuit schematic, with important notes.

2. eFish_Finder_V1.0B_20190920.zip

Contains the same set of files as in eFish_Finder_V1.0B-20190920.zip for an alternative version of the circuit board in which resistor R1 is replaced with a jumper (J1) for resistor insertion. 
This alternative design permits the user to remove and add resistors to vary the gain of the bio-amplifier. This may be helpful in special circumsances: e.g. use in water with very high conductivity.


3. eFish_Finder_V1.0_Resources.zip

Contains: 

Component list for PCB assembly, including bio-amplifier chassis and probe assembly
Publications describing earlier versions
