This repository contains three sets of files in .zip folders  

1. eFish_V1.0.zip

Contains:

1.1. eFish_V1.0_PCB_Picture.PNG 
(PCB schematic - created in Eagle)

1.2. eFish_V1.0_Schematic_Picture.PNG
(Circuit schematic - created in Eagle)

1.3. eFish_Finder_V1.0_Eagle_files.zip

(contains two files that can be opened and Edited in Eagle: eFish_Finder_V1.0.brd, eFish_Finder_V1.0.brd)

1.4. eFish_Finder_V1.0_Gerber_files.zip

(.zip compressed folder containing 8 files:
	eFish_Finder_V1.0.cmp
	eFish_Finder_V1.0.drd
	eFish_Finder_V1.0.dri
	eFish_Finder_V1.0.gpi
	eFish_Finder_V1.0.plc
	eFish_Finder_V1.0.sol
	eFish_Finder_V1.0.stc
	eFish_Finder_V1.0.sts
This zip folder and its contents is required by PCB manufacturing companies)

1.5. README eFish_Finder_V1.0

Key to the PCB schematic and circuit schematic, with important notes.

2. eFish_V1.0_B.zip

Contains the same set of files as in eFish_V1.0.zip for an alternative version of the circuit board in which resistor R1 is replaced with a jumper (J1) for resistor insertion. 
This alternative design permits the user to remove and add resistors to vary the gain of the bio-amplifier. This may be helpful in special circumsances: e.g. use in water with very high conductivity.


3. eFishV_1.0_Resources.zip

Contains: 

Component list for PCB assembly, including bio-amplifier chassis and probe assembly
Publications describing earlier versions
